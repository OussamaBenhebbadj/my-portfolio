        Hello! I am Oussama Benhebbadj, a fourth-year computer science student specializing in Software Engineering at the École Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique in Algiers, passionate about web development, UI/UX design, and technological innovation. My journey in tech began with a strong interest in creating user-centric and efficient applications that solve real-world problems.  

        With solid skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and frameworks such as React, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and MySQL, I strive to build engaging and impactful digital experiences. I have worked on various projects, including a patient management application for a clinic and an e-commerce website. I also had the opportunity to design and develop a platform for gym management using Python for a local client.  

        Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating on projects that challenge me to think critically and creatively. My recent participation in events, as well as winning an Arduino workshop competition, has strengthened my teamwork and problem-solving skills. I am also passionate about entrepreneurship and innovation, which is why I am actively involved in ETIC, a student club that fosters these values. In addition, I am currently the Design Manager of the sports club at my school, where I contribute to shaping creative and engaging visual identities.  

        I am excited to keep learning, growing, and building solutions that truly make a difference. <br /> Let’s create something amazing together!
